You can use the Additional CSS option in the customizer to
update the width. 

Copy and paste the following code into the Additional CSS option,
and adjust the percentages as needed:

.blog-wrapper {
	max-width: 80%;
}

And include the following to also increase the width of the main content.
#primary {
